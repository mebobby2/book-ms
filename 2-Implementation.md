# The Implementation Breakthrough: Continuous Deployment, Microservices, and Containers
When *continuous deployment*, *microservices*, and *containers* are combined, new doors open waiting for us to step through. Recent developments in the area of containers and the concept of immutable deployments enable us to overcome many of the problems microservices had before. They, on the other hand, allow us to gain flexibility and speed without which CD is not possible or cost effective.

## Continuous Integration
To understand continuous deployment we should first define its predecessors; continuous integration and continuous delivery.

Integration phase of a project development tended to be one of the most painful stages in software development life-cycle. We would spend weeks, months or even years working in separate teams dedicated to separate applications and services. While it wasnâ€™t hard to periodically verify each of those applications and services in isolation, we all dreaded the moment when team leads would decide that the time has come to integrate them into a unique delivery.

Extreme Programming (XP) and other agile methodologies become familiar, automated testing become frequent, and continuous integration started to take ground. Today we know that the way we developed software back then was wrong.

Continuous integration (CI) usually refers to integrating, building, and testing code within the development environment. It requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository often, in most cases, be done at least a couple of times a day. Getting code to the shared repository is not enough and we need to have a pipeline that, as a minimum, checks out the code and runs all the related tests. The result of the execution of the pipeline can be either red or green.

The continuous integration pipeline should run on every commit or push. Unlike continuous delivery, continuous integration does not have a clearly defined goal of that pipeline. Saying that one application integrates with others does not tell us a lot about its production readiness. We do not know how much more work is required to get to the stage when the code can be delivered to production. All we are truly striving for is the knowledge that a commit did not break any of the existing tests.

To gain maximum benefits, we should write tests in test-driven development (TDD) fashion. Tests are not the only CI prerequisite. One of the most important rules is that when the pipeline fails, fixing the problem has higher priority than any other task. If this action is postponed, next executions of the pipeline will fail as well. People will start ignoring the failure notifications and, slowly, CI process will begin losing its purpose.

The most common flow is the following.
1. Pushing to the code repository
2. Static analysis
3. Pre-deployment testing
4. Packaging and deployment to the test environment
5. Post-deployment testing
